This is a sample markdown file, it exists to demonstrate a bug.

This line left-goblinincludes a concealmentright-goblin which, the hidden characters should be visisble when the line is hovered, due to concealcursor being set by the after/ftplugin file.

If you have already activated the non-bug fuction, you must quit and restart vim to reproduce the bug again.
